    content: `<p>The landscape of leadership in India is undergoing a profound transformation. Today's young leaders are not just inheriting the structures built by previous generations—they're reimagining them from the ground up. This shift represents one of the most exciting developments in contemporary Indian business and society.</p>

<p>Young leaders bring a unique perspective characterized by digital nativity, global exposure, and a deep commitment to social responsibility. They understand that profit and purpose are not mutually exclusive; instead, they view business as a force for positive change.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: var(--text-xl); font-weight: var(--font-bold); margin: var(--space-6) 0 var(--space-4); color: var(--color-black);">Key Characteristics of Modern Youth Leaders</h3>

<ul style="margin-bottom: var(--space-6); padding-left: var(--space-6);">
  <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-3);"><strong>Sustainability Focus:</strong> They prioritize environmental and social impact alongside financial returns.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-3);"><strong>Digital Innovation:</strong> Leveraging technology to create scalable, efficient solutions.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-3);"><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Building diverse teams and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-3);"><strong>Agility:</strong> Quick to adapt and pivot based on market feedback and changing circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: var(--text-xl); font-weight: var(--font-bold); margin: var(--space-6) 0 var(--space-4); color: var(--color-black);">The Impact on Industries</h3>

<p>From fintech to sustainable fashion, healthcare to education technology, young leaders are disrupting traditional industries. They're not asking "Why change?" but rather "Why not change?" This mindset has led to innovations that were previously unimaginable.</p>

<p>The startup ecosystem in India has become a testament to this leadership style. Companies founded by millennials and Gen Z entrepreneurs are attracting global investment and creating millions of jobs while addressing critical social challenges.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: var(--text-xl); font-weight: var(--font-bold); margin: var(--space-6) 0 var(--space-4); color: var(--color-black);">Challenges and Opportunities</h3>

<p>While the future looks promising, young leaders face significant challenges including access to capital, market resistance to change, and the pressure to scale quickly. However, these challenges also present opportunities for mentorship, collaboration, and innovation.</p>

<p>The path forward requires creating ecosystems that support young leaders—through mentorship, funding, policy support, and community. As we look to the next decade, the role of youth leadership will be crucial in shaping India's trajectory.</p>`
